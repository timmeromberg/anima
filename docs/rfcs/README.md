# Anima RFCs

RFCs (Requests for Comments) are the process for proposing changes to the Anima language specification.

## Process

1. **Draft** — Copy `0000-template.md` and fill in your proposal. Number it sequentially (0001, 0002, ...).
2. **Submit** — Open a pull request with your RFC.
3. **Review** — Discussion happens on the PR. Iterate on feedback.
4. **Decision** — RFC is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn.
5. **Implementation** — If accepted, update the relevant spec documents and grammar.

## When to Write an RFC

- Adding a new language construct or keyword
- Changing existing syntax or semantics
- Adding to the type system
- Modifying the runtime architecture
- Any change that affects backward compatibility

## When NOT to Write an RFC

- Fixing typos in the spec
- Adding examples or clarifications
- Updating documentation that doesn't change language semantics
