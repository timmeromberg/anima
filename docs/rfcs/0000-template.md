## Summary

One paragraph summary of the proposal.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What problem does it solve? What use cases does it enable?

## Detailed Design

### Syntax

Show the proposed syntax with examples:

```anima
// Example code showing the proposed feature
```

### Grammar Changes

Show the EBNF additions/modifications:

```ebnf
// Grammar rules
```

### Semantics

Describe how the feature behaves at runtime. Include:
- Type system interactions
- Confidence propagation behavior (if applicable)
- Agent interactions (if applicable)
- Memory implications (if applicable)

### Examples

Provide 2-3 realistic examples demonstrating the feature:

```anima
// Example 1: Basic usage
```

```anima
// Example 2: Advanced usage / edge case
```
